* Quick Overview of:

- History and Origins
- Semantics
- Tools and Dev Environments

* History and Origins

- Conceived late 2007 at Google. Rob Pike, Ken Thompson. 
- A systems language: write, read, debug and maintain large software systems.
- Designed for scale: large programs with large numbers of dependencies, large numbers of programmers.
- Stated goal: _Clean_ _procedural_ _language_ _designed_ _for_ _scalable_ _cloud_ _software._ [1]

* Semantics

- Small, simple and opinionated. 
- Compiled, statically typed.  Extremely fast compilations.
- Concurrency at the language level:  native, robust, designed for multicore machines.
- Garbage-collected. 

* Simplicity

- As of Go 1, the language is fixed:

- Go will not compete on features.
- Too many features, one spends time choosing which ones to use.
- Implement, refine, possibly rethink, redo. 

* Readability

- Is it possible the code is harder to understand because it is using a more complex language?
- Features add complexity.
- Preferable to have just one way, or at least fewer, simpler ways.
- Opinionated.

* A few features

- Garbage Collection
- Concurrency 
- Interfaces

* As of Go 1.6: ~3ms GC pause time [1]:

* Concurrency 

- goroutines
- foobar

* Interfaces

- Perhaps Go's more powerful feature
- No concept of class inheritance: no _inherits_, _implements_, nor _extends_ keywords 
- Structural (aka duck) typing: _interface_
- Create abstractions by considering the _behavior_ that is common between datatypes
- Enables true component architectures and library design.
